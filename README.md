For the one part you need files from a link that he provides in jupiter notebook.
You need the "instrument_dataset" which you download to your local machine in the folder youre working in
that should be a .tgz file expand it to the same location should be a .tar file expand it again to get .npy files.
Then put those files in a folder called "instrument_dataset"
